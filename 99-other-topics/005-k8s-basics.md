# Kubernetes Basics - Links to helpful beginner resources

The purpose of this page is to serve as a small catalogue of links to basic Kubernetes concepts and learning resources.

## The Concept

Kubernetes is very often referred to as **"K8s"**, purely for the reason, that typing Kubernetes over and over gets quite taxing.

If Kubernetes is a totally new concept to you, then firstly you should probably check out a few of the resources linked below:

Official Website: 
[https://kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io)

Offical Docs: 
[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts)

Quick concept video: 
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMOZCDhH7do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMOZCDhH7do)

A part of the concept that is missing from the main offical document is Ingress.
Here's a link that expalins that concept: [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress)

## Experiment with Local Hosting 

To keep costs low and for learning the basics, it is possible to host a Kubernetes Cluster locally on your machine. Docker and Minikube both provide tools for this:

Docker: [https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/kubernetes](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/kubernetes)

Minikube: [https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/kubernetes)

Kubernetes is normally used with one of the big 3 cloud providers. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Engine, and Microsoft Azure.

## Command Line Kubernetes Interaction

Kubernetes has it's own official CLI tool for interacting with a Cluster called `kubectl`. It is certainly worth learning the basics of `kubectl`, As the vast majority of time interacting with Kubernetes will be through this tool.

We have our own page on [Kubectl Basics](/03-other-topics/003-quick-reference/#kubectl-quick-reference).

## Online Courses

You will find a multitude of courses online that offer to teach the basics of Kubernetes (and beyond). Some are better than others, some are free, and some require a subscription or one-off payment for access.

Two popular course sites, for example are:

### Pluralsight
[https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/getting-started-kubernetes](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/getting-started-kubernetes)

### Udacity
[https://eu.udacity.com/course/scalable-microservices-with-kubernetes--ud615](https://eu.udacity.com/course/scalable-microservices-with-kubernetes--ud615)
