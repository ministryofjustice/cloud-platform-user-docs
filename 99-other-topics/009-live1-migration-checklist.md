# Live 1 Migration Checklist

## Overview
After some long consideration of possible options, the decision has been made to migrate from the `live-0` cluster to the new `live-1` cluster.

The reason behind this decision is based on the need to move to a dedicated AWS account, which will be much easier to support, and the need to move away from the Ireland (EU) region to the London (UK) region.

The purpose of this document is to aid development teams in migrating their existing applications from `live-0` to `live-1`.
