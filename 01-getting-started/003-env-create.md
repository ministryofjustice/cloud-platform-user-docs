# Creating a Cloud Platform Environment

## Aim

This is a guide to creating a non-production environment in our non-production Kubernetes cluster. This document is intended for any developers who are interested in creating a development or staging environments within Kubernetes.

## Description

[cloud-platform-environments repo](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments)

This repo contains the necessary files to create a pipeline in AWS to create Kubernetes cluster namespaces and resources after a push has been made to the master branch of this repo.

This repo contains the following files and directories

#### Terraform

This directory contains terraform resources to create AWS pipeline for creation of kubernetes namespace and resource creation.

#### Buildspec

The `buildspec.yaml` file contains codebuild specification that will create resources defined in the namespaces.

#### Namespace

The namespaces contains subdirectories named after each of the desired namespaces you want to create.

You will be working within the namespace directory to create your environment.

### GitHub directory structure

**cloud-platform-environments**

![Image](images/env-repo-structure.png)

This is the root of the repo, containing Terraform and namespaces directories. Namespaces is where you will create a subdirectory for your service in the format `$servicename-$env`
example: myapp-dev

**$Servicename-$env**

When you create your `$servicename-$env` directory for your service. You will need to create two files within it. `namespaces.yaml` and `$servicename-$env-admin-role.yaml`

#### Instructions

![Image](images/image2.png)

**1)** Git clone the repo onto your local machine and create a new branch to make your changes. (Using terminal)

```
  #git clone the repo onto your local machine.
  $ git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments.git

  # change directory into the k8s-non prod repo
  cd cloud-platform-environments/

  #create new branch in the repo, my-app is used as an example, you can call it something descriptive.
  $ git checkout -b my-app

  #you can confirm you are using the branch you made using the command.
  $ git branch -a

  #Current branch you are currently using will be indicated by the *.

    master
  * my-app
    remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
    remotes/origin/add-git-crypt
```


**2)** Now we need to amend the namespaces directory in the root of repo and create an directory within it.

```
#we will need to change directories and change into the namespaces directory.
cd namespaces/$cluster

#we shall now be in our namespaces directory but we can confirm by the following command.
pwd

#output should show that we are in the namespaces directory. This will all be dependent on where you have chosen to git clone the repo. In this example the repo was cloned into the Git directory which is located in Documents.

$ pwd
/Users/$username/Desktop/Git/cloud-platform-environments/namespaces/$cluster

#Now we must create the directory for our service, the name of the directory we create should be in the format $servicename-$env
$ mkdir myapp-dev

#Now that we have created our namespaces subdirectory $servicename-env, lets now change into this directory.
$ cd myapp-dev
```


**3)** Now we will need to create two files within our `$servicename-$env` directory.  `Namespaces.yaml` and `$servicename-$env-admin-role.yaml`. The structures of both files are shown below.


**namespaces/$cluster/$servicename-$env/namespace.yaml**

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: myapp-dev
  labels:
    name: myapp-dev
```

**Namespace:**

Namespaces is a mechanism in Kubernetes that will essentially create your environment. 

Kubernetes namespace creates a logical cluster within our cluster that provides isolation from any other namespace.

Using a Kubernetes namespace could isolate namespaces for different environments in the same cluster. Providing us with flexibility of creating segregated environments for different.

**Namespace.yaml**

```
apiVersion: 
kind: 
metadata:
      name: This is where you will define your $servicename-$env
      labels:
           name: Also define your $servicename-$env
```

[https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/namespaces-walkthrough/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/namespaces-walkthrough/)

**cloud-platform-environments/namespaces/$cluster/$servicename-$env/$service-$name-admin-role.yaml**

```
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: myapp-dev-admins
  namespace: myapp-dev
subjects:
  - kind: Group
    name: "github:$yourTeam"
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: admin
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

**Rolebinding:**

We will also create a Rolebinding resouce that will provide us with access policies to the namespace we have created in the cluster.

A rolebinding resource grants the permissions defined in a role to a user or set of users. A role can be another resource we can create but in this instance we will reference (roleRef) a Kubernetes default role "ClusterRole - admin" .

This Rolebinding resource references the ClusterRole to provide ClusterRole admin access to a set of users which is defined under subjects. In this case, the `$yourTeam` github group will have admin access to any resources within the namespace "myapp dev".

`$servicename-$env-admin-role.yaml`

Example of yaml above, i will explain parts that need to be changed.

```
kind: 
apiVersion:
metadata:
     name:
     namespace: Define your namespace as created in namespace.yaml, this is where its mapped.
subjects:
     kind: 
     name: This is where you specify your Github team, as format shown above "github:$yourTeam"
     apiGroup:
roleRef: 
     kind: 
     name:
     apiGroup:
```

[https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/)

```
within our $servicename-$env directory, you will need to create the two files shown above. You can use any file editor of your choice (nano, vim).

$ cd myapp-dev/       								# Make sure you are in your service directory.
$ vi namespace.yaml   								#create the namespace.yaml and use guide above to help structure file.
$ vi myapp-dev-admin-role.yaml 						#once completed do the same for admin-role file.
$ ls                            					#list files in $Servicename-$dev directory, to see both files have been saved.
myapp-dev-admin-role.yaml	namespace.yaml   		#output after running list command.

##Remember these are Yaml files, so make sure syntax is correct. If syntax is incorrect then file may not build properly, you can use a online validator.
#https://codebeautify.org/yaml-validator

```


**4)** After both files are created. You are ready to upload your branch to our github repo. You will need to add the files, commit them and then set a new upstream branch.

```
# Add all new files from your current directory to staging.
$ git add

# Can run the command git status to check what changes are to be commited.
$ git status

# output will show files that are to be commited in green.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   namespaces/myapp-dev/myapp-dev-admin-role.yaml
	new file:   namespaces/myapp-dev/namespace.yaml

#once your happy with the files to be uploaded, you can now run git commit to commit the files and -m parameter to add message to your commit.
$ git commit -m "adding namespace.yaml and admin-roles for myapp to create dev environment"

#Should get output reflecting files added.

 create mode 100644 namespaces/non-production.k8s.integration.dsd.io/myapp-dev/namespace.yam

#Now you are ready to upload your branch to the repo. myapp being your branch name.
git push --set-upstream origin myapp

#Now you can go to the repo in the GITHUB GUI and make a pull request to merge your branch with master.
```


**5)** Now that you have uploaded your branch, go to the Github GUI and select your branch. Once you have done this, you may make a pull request to merge to master.
